# Understanding Null in dart 

>Control flow analysis is a static analysis technique used in programming language theory and compilers to analyze and understand the possible paths that a program's control flow can take. It involves examining how control flows through different parts of the program, including loops, conditionals, and branches.

>Control flow analysis is really good for detecting null problems within local variables and parameters but when it comes to fields, instance field, static fields, top-level varialbes control flow doesnot work very well.
